                Simon Says is a classic memory and listening game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The game
                tests your ability to remember and follow a sequence of colors. Here's how you can play:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Press any key to start the game. The level will be displayed as "Level 1."</li>
                <li>Watch as Simon shows a sequence of colored buttons by briefly flashing them.</li>
                <li>After Simon's sequence, it's your turn to repeat the pattern. Click on the colored buttons in the
                    same
                    order as Simon.</li>
                <li>If you correctly repeat the sequence, Simon will add another color to the pattern, and you move on
                    to
                    the next level.</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake and click the wrong color or the wrong order, the game will end, and you'll
                    have
                    to start over.</li>
                <li>The goal is to see how many levels you can reach and how long you can remember the growing sequence
                    of
                    colors.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Remember, listen carefully and watch the sequence closely. Good luck and have fun playing Simon Says!
